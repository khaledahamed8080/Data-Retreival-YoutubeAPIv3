"I am a soon-to-be former iPhone user (perhaps “cult member” is a better term) but having trouble deciding which Android phone to replace it with. I really do not want just an “iPhone replacement” - I want something different. I am leaning toward the Pixel Pro to get the “purest” Android experience, but the folding/flipping phones really have my interest so I can also get rid of my iPad. My phone use is daily things like we all do (except I am that one person in the world not on social media). Weather, emails, messages, maps/travel and looking up info sometimes are the norm for me. I do not have or need everything on every device - Apple thinks that is important but I have grown to see it is not necessary for most things - I would never do heavy-duty spreadsheets on a phone so why would I need it.<br><br>However the slow processor with Pixel is one thing, and it is similar to the iPhone in many way otherwise. I am also not a gamer but need to make sure the device fits my future needs. I look at Samsung - definitely different,  but the bloatware is a problem plus the price tag and camera processing looks worse than the Pixel. I do like the Fold and Flip. And there are others, but I have concerns.<br><br>I am definitely NOT one of the foreigner-hating “We’re #1” Americans, but I do have to consider the issues with government snooping on some Chinese-owned phone manufacturers. They have many great features, and that Huawei in this video looks way cool with a great design, but am I stuck in choosing between Samsung and Google for a new device?<br><br>It may seem silly to some since Google is all about gathering info, but if I can look at other options I will. I just want to know what the consensus is about security and privacy on these other phone manufacturers. I have tried to look it up online and when searching all I get is a list of racist tirades by stupid people. It would really be helpful if all of the reviewers start including this info in their reviews to really make them complete reviews.<br><br><br><br>Thanks."
I wonder if they will try and add a blutooth pen to it like the note use to have  .
I&#39;d think about it... with a decent battery. That one won&#39;t make it for me. At all.
$3k for this thing is insane tho 😮😢
It&#39;s a pocketable tablet.
Other than the Chinese version this phone is the first step for road working Americans to drop the tablet/laptop for a mobile version.
nice lmao
I’ll wait for the 8 when the creases are gone
👍
"I have the Fold 7. If you rotate the phone 90 degrees, you will get a larger picture and also the tablet youtube as well."
"As someone who travels, thi sis perfect. Dont have to carry a tablet and can use this for emails etc"
Similar price to a quality gaming pc....Ill pass and stick to my fold.
Who watches a full screen video at portrait mode on a Z Fold 7? 🤪🤣
"I know it&#39;s a big ask, but I would really miss the S-Pen if I got this.  I use it so much.  But also, this is so b.a. I really want it."
This is a bookworm&#39;s dream 😍
Missed opportunity to fold it in a Z shape when it&#39;s called the Galaxy &quot;Z&quot;.
Price is 2899 dollars tho 😭
"My Z fold 7s larger display broke in just 5 month, It some how craked in the center the damage was just limited within the screen protector , now it can have 3 cracks 😅"
"what is the actual battery life on something like this? How long can one reasonably use this (fully opened and browsing the web, split screen, etc) before needing to charge it? I can picture this thing guzzling battery"
No one needs a foldable phone. However a foldable tablet is useful.
Is this phone dust/Water Resistant rated? i JUST ordered the Pixel Fold 10 because I need a new phone right now and my work is dusty but if this is dust/water resistant rated I might trade in when this is out.
"It sure has utility, essentially being able to carry a tablet in your pocket. On the other hand, a tablet is like 200 dollars and a phone is 150 dollars. So, I think some people will definitely get it, but not that many."
I&#39;m really hoping Apple releases a tri-fold iPhone!
They should make foldables 3 mm taller and 1 mm wider. It would make a way better aspect ratio in landscape but still be unnoticeable when folded. So like a 8.5 inch display or close to it just slightly more rectangular
they missed a great opportunity to call it the uPhone
"it&#39;s also cool that the inner screen is hidden in the single screen configuration, considering the inner screen is soft and very susceptible to deep scratches. i hope they can develop some sort of jelly screen protectors for them that bounce back into place after being indented."
VR makes this pointless
If it came and supoorted a pen it would be perfect. the fact that it doesnt makes this phone kinda useless.
That&#39;s the thing from hitchikers guide to the galaxy... But better. And a galaxy. And more than wikipedia. Lol
Having a screen that huge and no S-pen support is really sad. Same cameras as my z Fold 7. I think i am going to sit this one out. Just not enough to justify the upgrade.
Has this video been a different language for like a month for anyone else? I&#39;ve been trying to watch this video but I couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying🤣🤣
"I def want it, but not for $2500 🥲"
Turn the fold sideways for a larger picture.
Is it a foldable tablet or a foldable phone.
Waiting for Samsung z fold origami ...
"The tri fold is definitely dope buttttt I think the way it folds is a miss. The Z style fold I think is the way, each fold imo should reveal more screen not less and it&#39;s more versatile, there will be situations where the you want to use it in a normal fold and situations where you want the trifold. I can&#39;t see myself getting one until they make it a true Z fold."
Almost double the price but definitely double the crease :P
I will only ever buy a trifold if it comes with S-Pen support and passes the JerryRigEverything bend test.
"Hey mkbhd why your subtitles by default language is japanese not English is suck, i don&#39;t like that"
Main screen is 1080p. Nah.
It&#39;s DOUBLE FOLD not tri. Stupid marketing.
Add a fold out keyboard and I&#39;m there
If only you could all that extra thickness and make it it&#39;s own device?
doesn’t look good.
Truth is that Samsung is selling junk fold phones and making money from repairs/bad practices.
Make it make sense....how dose it fold twice then call it a tri-fold
gotta say huawei&#39;s trifold looks much cooler
"Where&#39;s the money going for it to cost so much, I&#39;d just cop the other option that existed longer and did it better"
Would love to see your first impressions when the Samsung &quot;Wide&quot; Fold is pre-released. I understand this is Samsung&#39;s response to Apple&#39;s first folding phone and would love to see Samsung crush them. 😊
My super old Galaxy Note 10+ is I think nearing it&#39;s battery&#39;s end. So many very exciting options I don&#39;t even know where to look! ❤
This is definitely too expensive. Since when are we okay with 2k dollar phones?
"My z fold 3 ended up failing pretty bad along the crease. The ribbon cable that connected the halves together failed and at first I just lost audio, then I lost the screen altogether.<br>As cool as this phone is, and as much as I love split screen multitasking (my fold 3 often had youtube at the top, then discord on one half at the bottom, and some mobile game on the other bottom half), I&#39;m not sure I can stomach this price just for the hinges to fail on me again.<br>I also think that video comparison at around 5 minutes was a bit disingenuous, at 21:9 on the original video, and with the old fold in portrait, you really set it up to fail. With a 16:9 video in landscape mode, it is noticably bigger than a normal slab phone. And thats ignoring the idea that if you WERE watching a video in portrait mode, you probably used that negative space for some split screen apps."
"Just one thing I&#39;m wondering: why didn&#39;t you show regular foldables in horizontal view? The phone&#39;s already horizontal, and a trifold doesn&#39;t really need horizontal mode to use the full screen for content. A normal foldable in horizontal view is still bigger than a phone. But the way you showed it makes it seem like watching content is the same as on a regular phone!"
This is definitely the future of phones. Because I can see everyone looking back at current phones and thinking &quot;WOW&quot; &quot;That looks like ancient technology&quot;. With cloud computing these phones could even replace a work computer.
"honestly this looks great, esp for someone like me who doesn&#39;t have a tablet since I&#39;m always thinking, &#39;&#39;well am I gonna use it enough to justify it if I&#39;m just gonna take my phone everywhere and use that&#39;&#39;... but this would theoretically make that a non-issue. Too bad the price is insane, but maybe years down the line when there&#39;s a bunch of versions of this and maybe cheaper alternatives from other brands too, then I might consider it for a new phone lol<br><br>Still insanely cool though"
"What do you mean the price isn&#39;t insane?  I can literally buy an iPad, an iPhone and a MacBook Air for less.  Or I could just buy a phone and a tablet and save myself a thousand dollars.   This is what happens when you start making too much money.  You lose track of what &quot;normal&quot; people want and can afford.  Even for $1000 less, I still wouldn&#39;t buy a phone that cost more than my first car."
Huawei&#39;s trifold is better because you can unfold it to a dual screen and if you want to three screens.
"I simply still can&#39;t fathom why the need for foldable phone. IMHO, phone should be high storage capacity, low cost (since there&#39;s a huge economy of scale already), long battery run time, less camera lens... Thanks but no thanks!! I&#39;ll stick with the Samsung A series phone!!"
Camera inside should be put in the middle.
"The dex without external accessories is amazing, if there was an optional magnetic attached stylus or similar like the Samsung tablet I could use the excuse &quot;using it for work&quot; plus a phone could easily justify a higher price. I would preorder right now.<br><br><br>Instead of buying a tablet and phone I could have all in one for about the same price... Only tipping point would be the battery life. Does anyone know the difference between the single screen vs multiscreen battery life?"
"Biggest con is the price! If they want to sell that, and make it a new standard they&#39;d need to make super aggressive prices. Im talking 1000$ max"
TOO BIG! 8 inches is the sweet spot. It&#39;s also thicker and more weighted in your pocket than the regular Z Fold.
Why do I feel like the aspect ratio of this video is different?
now it makes sense
"Such a beautiful Samsung device — videos like this remind me why I admire Samsung so much. @Marques Brownlee, I’m still hoping for a chance to get a used Samsung phone, as I currently don’t have one and truly need it. Thank you for the constant inspiration and great tech content."
Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design so beautiful 😘
How can we install google play store?<br><br>It doesnt come pre loaded
Jerry &quot;...with deeper grooves at level 2...&quot; <br><br>I&#39;ll pass on foldables until they change the cheap plastic on the inside.
Turn the fold 7 sideways ther frame gsts bigger
People with ocd boutta be going crazy from the imperfect satisfaction
"Doesn’t make sense at all, Marques is losing it prefer the review from Mr Mobile being real as larger screen means multi tasking but it’s not working , just get a laptop or tablet. 50% more failure"
"The creases, don&#39;t bother me, i&#39;ve had my 5 for 2 year now. Ill get the tri a couple of years from now."
this is like the early protable computers with a 2h autonomy
Thanks
"I want one, but am in the UK..."
This should&#39;ve been named a Bi Fold 🤔
"Okay, I follow you and like most of your videos, but I have a problem with your take on the foldables here. You are explaining the screen size while watching videos, holding the brick phone horizontally and the bifold vertically. I don&#39;t think this is an honest comparison. Either hold both vertically or both horizontally. I have a bifold and always turn it sideways (like a brick phone) to watch media. I understand that there are still black bars, but the screen size difference is more noticeable when you rotate it. I will keep buying foldables as they provide a huge difference in screen size when used correctly and might switch to trifold when the price is right, don&#39;t think I will go back to normal brick style phones (for me, the advantages outweigh the few problems with foldables)."
this will be good for reading ebook
I ain’t spending $2.5k - $3k on an Android. Got me fkd up.
❤❤❤ wow I am impressed I will be eager to look into switching to this off of iPhone. I have always wished since the galaxy note that a phone would someday become a tablet as well so not so many devices are needed.
"lets try to peel the screen protector <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>"
The United States and Europe should treat Korea well.
"Why do Korean and Japan and China gets it first, MAGA should get it first."
Markuss sold out
Only an idiot would not know the right way to fold it.
Im convinced this phone will have a disastrous response in terms of demand. Honestly the price and the utility don’t match. Looks inconvenient to use.
"The only thing that doesn’t make sense (for me at least) is the outer screen being in the middle when opened; which renders the device not mountable in tablet form. I think they should make the main camera portion in the middle and the external screen flip back to the front instead of having to turn the device over, like the bifold but with an extra fold on the other side. More natural that way, and the device can be mounted as a tablet, and case can be easier to make as well"
"Trifold halves the screen fold angle range for each hinge from [0, 180] to [90, 180]! I bet that that allows them to hide the crease and make the screen even more durable! Pretty smart!"
"If it is anything like the fold, give it a few months and it&#39;ll be broken"
Next step: Origami phone<br>Fold that shit 17 times 😂
How does it work when pumping the font and icon size as large as possible to aide senior users or people who are weak in their vision? What&#39;s that user experience like?
This phone is Inspired by Huawei
I have the Z Fold 7. It is my third (I had the 3 and the 5). I will 100% buy the Trifold 2 if they release one.
I would sooner buy iPhone 14
"When apple releases their version of this phone, I’m not asking about the price."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trsHTKqmZOk&amp;t=78"">1:18</a> that looks really cool<br><br>But its a bummer theres no dual panel, it just goes from single screen to three screen"
"Seeing this phone with that embarrassing second screen in black while on a Huawei phone you can see 1, 2, or 3 screens makes me think that the Chinese are much more advanced in these phones. If I were Samsung, I wouldn&#39;t release such an embarrassing phone to the market."
I&#39;m gonna wait for the Quad Fold
I just got the flip 7 a couple days ago. Im really digging it. The compact nature of it makes it super convenient to just pull out and do whatever with one hand. This tri fold is cool. But it seems kinda inconvenient.
